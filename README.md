## The first iteration of my personal website <a href="http://etarasova.me/">etarasova.me</a> built with Gatsby and hosted with Netlify

<p>For creating this website I used HTML UP Prologue - a simple, single page responsive site template. It features a clean, minimalistic design and a sticky sidebar with navigation-linked scrolling. </p>
